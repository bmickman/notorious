  Notorious Octopus was brought on to lead a critical phase of the studio’s digital transformation. Our primary focus was the hands-on migration of all website content and data to a new content management system (CMS). This involved re-architecting the site’s structure to enhance performance, usability, and scalability while ensuring a seamless user experience for global audiences. The result was a modern, polished online presence that aligns with the caliber of their award-winning creative work.
