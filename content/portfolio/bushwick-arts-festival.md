  title: Project Overview
  text: "<p>
The Bushwick Arts Festival was a vibrant, community-driven art event that brought together hundreds of emerging and established artists across a diverse range of venues—including private homes, working studios, independent galleries, and unconventional creative spaces. Designed to celebrate artistic expression in all its forms, the festival offered both first-time and seasoned artists an opportunity to connect with the public by inviting them directly into their creative environments. It was a celebration of accessibility, authenticity, and local talent.

Notorious Octopus was tasked with the comprehensive management and production of all branding and marketing assets for the festival. From conceptual development to execution, we led the creative direction for visual identity, promotional materials, and the public-facing website, ensuring consistency across all channels and touchpoints.  
In addition, we oversaw the production of a printed festival program, a project that required significant coordination with a wide range of external stakeholders—including venue managers, gallery curators, and individual artists. This collaborative effort involved gathering, organizing, and editing event information while maintaining alignment with the overall brand aesthetic and messaging. The end result was a cohesive, engaging experience that reflected the energy and diversity of the Bushwick arts community.
